* Codd's Relational Model
  * A relation (table) is a set of tuples (rows).
  * Each element in a tuple (cell value) is a data domain (set of allowed values).
  * These elements are called attribute values, and are associated with an attribute.
* Schema
  * The shape or structure of your data.
  * Tables, columnnames, types, and constraints.
  * Strongly connected to your data domain.
* Relational Algebra vs Relational Calculus
* Structured Query Language
  * Used to manage data in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
  * Declaratve, unlike its predecessors.
  * Can be procedural too! (PL/SQL)
  * Inspired by Codd's Relationa Model.
